Get two inputs and add the result and output in console when add button is clicked.
    - If input is a string the result will be concatination in JS(logical error)
    - You can avoid by type checking and correcting in JS
    - You can throw exception if string
    - But all this you can do in runtime.
- Use typescript to avoid this error in compilation.
    - Add parameter as number type
    - It works for input given in file
    - What about input given in runtime via HtmlinputElement
        - ! means not "null" will be passed
        - typecasting "! as HTMLInputElement"
        - Parse the input to number
