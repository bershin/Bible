Generally speaking, we can upload some text.

It could be a PDF, it could be a CSV, it could be whatever.

Then the "embeddings model" will come and it will make tokens out of our PDF.

This "tokens", they will get stored as "vector embeddings" in our vector database.

The vector database is three dimensional and there is a lot of space.

And we will make clusters with this these tokens.

So there's for example a clusters with fruits or clusters with animals or clusters, for example with

prices, if we have some prices there are different clusters.

And if we ask the lamb something, the lamb can then go search this vector database, search in the

right spot and we'll find the prices where the prices are, the fruits where the fruits are and the

animals where the animals are just like you.
